## Rails App with JavaScript Frontend Spec
## Project Specs:

&#10003; Must have a Rails Backend and new requirements implemented through JavaScript.

&#10003; Makes use of ES6 features as much as possible(e.g Arrow functions, Let & Const, Constructor Functions)

&#10003; Must translate the JSON responses into Javascript Model Objects using either ES6 class or constructor syntax.

&#10003; Must render at least one index page (index resource - 'list of things') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend. *[Recipe Index on User Dishes Page; Dishes Index on User Dishes Page]*

&#10003; Must render at least one show page (show resource - 'one specific thing') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend. *[Recipe Details Show on User Dishes Page; Substitution Show Resource Dynamically Appended After Submission to Recipe Show Page]*

&#10003; Your Rails application must reveal at least one `has-many` relationship through JSON that is then rendered to the page. *[Recipe has-many RecipeIngredients (and Ingredients) serialized in the JSON response parsed on User Dishes Page when User clicks each Recipe for More Details]*

&#10003; Must use your Rails application to render a form for creating a resource that is submitted dynamically through JavaScript. *[Substitution Form dynamically rendered, submitted, and displayed on Recipe Show Page; Add Recipe to Dishes Button/HiddenForm dynamically submitted and displayed on User Dishes Page]*

&#10003; At least one of the JS Model Objects must have a method on the prototype. *[Recipe Model, Dish Model, & Substitution Model Objects have RecipeDetailsHTML(), newDishHTML(), & newSubstitutionHTML() Prototype Methods, respectively, via ES6 Class Syntax]*

`+`

&#10003; DYNAMIC RECIPE FORM (Add or Remove Nested Fields Recipe_Ingredient & Ingredient) *[Built from Scratch / Not Just Cocoon]*

&#10003; DYNAMIC TOGGLE BUTTON for Ingredient Substitutions (Button Transitions From "Show" to "Hide" While Hiding/Revealing Substitutions Index) *[User Show Page / Grocery List / Home]*

&#10003; DYNAMIC ADD DISH from Dynamically Generated Recipe Index(AJAX Params POST Request via JSON and Dynamic Render) *[User Dishes Page]*

&#10003; USER EXPERIENCE (UX) Engaging Elements / JQUERY ANIMATIONS Throughout from HOVER FOCUS and SCROLL Effects to Dynamically Submitted/Rendered DELETE-ALL Buttons for Ease of Use) *[Throughout]*
